# HR-Attrition-Prediction
	Project Report to be created in ppt and excel
	Prepare data for Analysis,  Treat Missing Data, Wrong Data, Outlier Data
	Create new/derived predictors (e.g. Age group) for analysis
	Explore the Data using Exploratory Data Analysis - For Y and all Xs
	Explore the Data using Exploratory Data Analysis - For pairs of Y and  all Xs
	Visualize all the distribution, relationships
	Perform Test of Hypothesis - Compare rates for same level male and female, check relationship between categorical variables like Age and Gender/Gender and Education Field, Age and Income, etc
Note:	Use Test Data set and perform Cross Validation for selecting best model using Training Data
	Perform Regression treating Monthly Rate as Y, and choose prediction error and the best model
a) 	Use SLR, MLR, Polynomial Regression, Interaction term, Ridge Regression, Lasso etc
b)	Use KNN 
c) 	Use Decision Tree 
8	Form Classification Model using Y=attrition and choose the best model
a) 	Logistic Regression
b)	KNN
c) 	Baysian
d) 	Decision Tree
e)	SVM
f)	ANN
9	Clustering - Find intersting clusters using K-means, Heirarchical and DBSCAN clustering. Connect to Domain scenario and its usefulness in analysis (Ignore Attrition Column)
a) 	Grouping of Employees
